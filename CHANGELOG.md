## [Unreleased]

### Added
- changelog python package override

## 1.0.0 - 2021-07-03

### Added
- Markdown as a language and functions to turn markdown into html.
- `docs` as a target which can have requirements in the config file.
- Generated docs for rust and python that is merged with user written docs.
- Priority functions for determining deployment order in a combined deployment.
  Use `first` or `last` to set the deployment order of the component, or `priority` to set
  the priority explicitly.
- `targetsetup.nix` which python and rust now uses to setup new components. Variable names
  that exists in the project's config file under `components` are used instead of
  prompting user. Sending the set targetSetup to `mkPackage` in rust and python will
  combine attributes.  
- `versions.nix` which controls versions of some packages (rust, wasmer, wasmtime,
  ...). The set of versions is also accessible from `base`.
- `mkComponent` now accepts a `subComponents` set as an argument. The use of this is
  purely for convenience and will simply add the set of sub components to the component.
- Add `mkTheme` and theme as an argument to `mkProject`.
- Add shell alias for name of (rust) component that runs the component.
- Languages now also aliases their name to package so we can do `nix-build -A rust` to build all rust packages.
- `callFunction` method on base. Can be used in cases where you just want to evaluate an expression and don't have a file.
  You will need to specify the working directory manually since how else are we supposed to know where the shell is located
  when we just run a lambda.
- Shells for all targets, the default target for a component is `package` (can be changed in the project's config).
- `all` as a matrix target to build all targets on all components.

### Changed
- renamed `languages.python.mkUtility` and `languages.rust.mkUtility` to `mkLibrary`
- checks are now a separate evaluation of projects. i.e. call `override` on the result of `mkProject` with `{enableChecks = true;}`
- creating a component through `mkComponent` now require passing a name for it

### Removed
- `packageWithChecks` is no longer generated. See "Changed" for more details.

### Fixed
- Argument to combined deployment works the same as for regular deployment.
- shellInputs are now added to nativeBuildInputs instead of being an attribute on the
  derivation since that caused them to always be evaluated.
- Nested components are now included in the "all" matrix target.

## [0.8.1] - 2021-02-25

### Fixed
- Extend bases with dependencyProject's baseExtensions

## [0.8.0] - 2021-02-25

### Removed
- RUST_BACKTRACE was enabled by default. Removed it. Enable it manually when needed instead.
- sccache, was brittle and gave little benefit.
- Deploying from inside nix has been removed. Instead we create a deployment script which is called outside nix.

### Changed
- mkGrid does not exist anymore and instead a list of components is sent to mkProject and `matrix` is a 
  property on the project set, together with `shells`, `name`, `lib` etc. All attrs sent to `mkProject` also
  supports functions that takes a single set with members from `base`.
- Renamed `test` command to `check` due to bash if statement conflict (if statements actually run a function called test).
- Use niv for handling nix dependencies.
- Python overlays now work for both Python 3.7 and 3.8. Furthermore it is exposed both on the
  interpreter package and as <python-version>Packages.
- Set warnings as errors by default on all Rust projects. This can be turned off with the argument
  `warningsAsErrors` on all rust nix helpers (`mkService`, `mkClient` etc.).

### Added
- Make shells for nested components.
- mapComponentsRecursive available in base and nedryland.
- toUtility rust function that converts a rust package to a utility.
- `nixpkgs` as an attribute on nedryland to access the same version of packages nedryland uses.
- `mkDeployment` and `mkCombinedDeployment`.
- `mkClient` for python.
- Rust packages has proper cross-compilation support
- Support for checks when cross-compiling (set `doCrossCheck=true` to run `checkPhase` when
  cross-compiling.
- Examples of transitive protobuf modules.
- Language helper for generating protobuf modules.
- DeclareComponent supports returning attribute sets.
- Support for vendoring internal rust dependencies.
- Marker for Nedryland components, isNedrylandComponent = true.
- Automatically set MYPYPATH from propagatedBuildInputs in python packages.
- Support arbitrary attribute for python packages and make checkInputs, buildInputs, propagatedBuildInputs optional.
- Add overlays for python packages: cloudevents, functions-framework.
- Support arbitrary attribute for rust packages.
- Pre Terraform shell hook.
- Post Terraform shell hook.
- Terraform derivations accept nix store paths as source.
- Deploy target (`<component>.deploy`) that is a list of all attributes in the `deployment` of the
  component.

## [0.7.0] - 2020-08-27

### Added
- Expose Nedryland docs
- Add a state lock timeout to some TF ops

### Fixed
- Terraform plans are outputted in ascii
- Fixed missing rename in deployment.nix (terraformModule -> terraformComponent)

## [0.6.0] - 2020-08-24

### Changed
- Add mkTerraformComponent which is a provider-agnostic terraform module intended for deployment.
- Rust functions can now pass in shellInputs and shellHooks.
- Make src path invariant for Python and Rust packages. This makes it cacheable for everyone, irrespective of
  their path to the repositories. See
  [this](https://nix.dev/anti-patterns/language.html#reproducability-referencing-top-level-directory-with)
  for more details.
- Rust packages no longer output duplicate dependencies üçÑ.
- Update rust-analyzer to 2020-08-03.

## [0.5.0] - 2020-07-29
### Added
- All python utilities now have wheels built as a separate derivation that then gets "linked" to the
  original derivation via a file in "$pkg/nedryland/wheels".

## [0.4.1] - 2020-07-23
### Fixed
- Only copy `setup.cfg` and `pylintrc` doesn't exist or it is a link for Python DCC functions.

## [0.4.0] - 2020-07-23
### Added
- Option to disable gbk tests for python packages.


## [0.3.1] - 2020-07-23
### Fixed
- Base extensions in dependant projects get combined base.


## [0.3.0] - 2020-07-23
### Added
- Added python language helper for utility libraries (base.languages.python.mkUtility).
