# The Development Environment

Nedryland uses `nix-shell` to provide a development environment for defined components. For this to
work, `shell.nix` in the root of the repository needs to expose the output of `project.mkShells`.

## Working on a component

To start a shell for working on a component called `hammond`, issue the command

```sh
$ nix-shell -A hammond
```

This will download and expose all dependencies necessary to work on `hammond`, change the directory
to where `hammond` is defined and create a new shell session.

## Get a Shell with all Components

The special target `all` (`nix-shell -A all`) will drop you in a shell session with access to all
build outputs of the whole project. This can be useful to test a set of components together.
